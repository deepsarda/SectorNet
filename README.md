# **SectorNet: A Decentralized Communication Platform**

**Your data, your communities, your control.**

---

## **1. Introduction & Vision**

SectorNet is a decentralized social communication platform architected entirely on the Internet Computer blockchain. It is born from the conviction that the future of online community should not be in the hands of centralized corporations, but in the hands of the users themselves. 

The project's vision is to create a ecosystem of interconnected, self-governed communities, free from the data harvesting, opaque algorithms, and centralized control points that define the current social media landscape.

### **Core Philosophy**
*   **Absolute Decentralization:** Every piece of data—from a user's profile to a single chat message—is stored on-chain within canisters. The entire application runs on the Internet Computer's public network, eliminating reliance on private servers.
*   **User Sovereignty & Ownership:** Users are identified by their self-custodied Internet Identity `Principal`. Content created by a user belongs to them; content created within a community belongs to that community.
*   **Community-Led Governance:** SectorNet is designed to become a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Its evolution, rules, and moderation are ultimately controlled by the community through on-chain voting and transparent proposals.
*   **Privacy by Design:** The architecture prioritizes user privacy. Private communications can be end-to-end encrypted, and the platform minimizes the collection of user data to the absolute essentials.

## **2. Key Features**

*   **100% On-Chain:** The entire platform—frontend, backend logic, and all user data—is hosted on the Internet Computer.
*   **Canister-Based Architecture:** The platform uses a Service-Oriented Architecture, where each community (**Sector**) is its own independent canister, ensuring scalability and resilience.
*   **Internet Identity:** Secure, passwordless authentication using the IC's native WebAuthn-based identity solution.
*   **Public & Private Sectors:** Users can create and join discoverable public communities or invite-only private groups.
*   **Dual-Tier Chat Security:**
    *   **High-Security E2EE Mode:** For small, private Sectors (<=50 members), offering verifiable end-to-end encryption with moderator-led key rotation.
    *   **Standard Access-Control Mode:** A scalable and performant model for large public communities.
*   **Global & Sector Feeds:** A curated public Global Feed aggregates high-quality posts, while each Sector maintains its own private, encrypted feed.
*   **The UI:** A unique design philosophy blending glass morphism with a terminal-inspired aesthetic for a focused, information-dense user experience.
*   **Role-Based Permissions:** A powerful `[User Tag | Sector Role]` system separates global platform status from local community roles.
*   **Spam & Sybil Resistance:** Built-in rate limiting on Sector creation and tenure-based requirements for governance participation.

## **4. Getting Started**

*(Instructions for developers to run the project locally. This assumes you have the DFINITY Canister SDK installed.)*

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sectornet.git
    cd sectornet
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start a local IC replica:**
    Open a new terminal window in the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    dfx start --clean --background
    ```

4.  **Deploy the canisters:**
    ```bash
    dfx deploy
    ```

5.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

You can now access the SectorNet frontend in your browser at the local address provided by the Vite server.

## **5. Roadmap & Upcoming Features**

SectorNet is in active development. Here are the key features on our immediate roadmap:

*   **Governance Module (SNS DAO):** Implementation of a full-fledged Decentralized Autonomous Organization for on-chain proposals and voting on platform upgrades and rule changes.
*   **UI for Governance & Voting:** Dedicated interfaces within the UI for creating, viewing, and voting on community proposals.
*   **Sector Management:** Controls for Sector Moderators, including detailed member lists, banning/kicking, and updating Sector metadata.
*   **Advanced Channel Management:** The ability for moderators to edit, delete, and reorder chat channels within a Sector.
*   **Self-Hosting Sectors:** Future capabilities for advanced users or organizations to deploy and manage their own Sector canisters, potentially with custom code.
*   **Global Content Search:** A powerful search engine to find posts across the entire public Global Feed.
*   **Unified Notification System:** A single, aggregated view for all mentions, replies, and other relevant events.
